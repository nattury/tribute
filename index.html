            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <div class="biography">
                <p>David Bowie was an English rock star known for dramatic musical transformations, including his
                    character Ziggy Stardust. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996.</p>
                <h3>Who Was David Bowie?</h3>
                <p>Rock star David Bowie's first hit was the song "Space Oddity" in 1969. The original pop chameleon,
                    Bowie became a fantastical sci-fi character for his breakout Ziggy Stardust album. He later co-wrote
                    "Fame" with Carlos Alomar and John Lennon, which became his first American No. 1 single in 1975. An
                    accomplished actor, Bowie starred in The Man Who Fell to Earth in 1976. He was inducted into the
                    Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Shortly after releasing his final album, Bowie died from cancer
                    on January 10, 2016. </p>
